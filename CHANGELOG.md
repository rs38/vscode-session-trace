# Changelog

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Windows ARM64 (`win32-arm64`) platform support in build and release workflows (#4, thanks @rs38)

### Changed
- Session tree view is now hidden by default; users can enable it from the Views menu or command palette
- Language model tool (`#searchChatSessions`) now triggers an incremental reindex before each query, ensuring agents always query up-to-date data

## [0.0.4] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Extension now runs on the UI side (`extensionKind: ["ui"]`) so it correctly finds chat session files in WSL, SSH, and Dev Container scenarios (fixes #2)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- Workspace filtering now uses normalized filesystem paths instead of folder names, fixing matching across URI formats (`file://`, Windows drive paths, `.code-workspace` files)
- Multi-root and `.code-workspace` file support for workspace identity detection
- Turn timestamps use a robust fallback chain (`request.timestamp` → `data.creationDate` → `summary.creationDate` → file mtime)
- Schema version bumped to 3 to trigger re-indexing with improved workspace IDs
- Path scrubbing for error messages refactored into a shared helper
- Tool icon switched to `$(watch)`

### Fixed
- File-edit annotation parsing no longer misidentifies Windows drive paths (e.g. `C:\...`) as URIs
- Mtime comparison uses strict inequality (`!==`) instead of less-than, ensuring edits that revert mtime trigger re-indexing
- `data.requests` validated with `Array.isArray()` instead of a truthy check, preventing crashes on malformed session data
- `workspace.json` reader now handles `workspace.configPath`, `workspace.folders`, and nested folder objects

## [0.0.2] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Extension icon and logo in README header

## [0.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Session tree view for browsing Copilot Chat JSONL sessions from disk
- Sorting and filtering toolbar in the session tree: sort by date, turn count, or name; filter by scope (all workspaces, current workspace, global storage, transferred) and time period (last 7 or 30 days)
- `$(open-preview)` inline action on session items to open the session as a formatted Markdown preview
- `$(go-to-file)` inline action on session items to open the raw JSONL file
- Full-text search command (`Session Trace: Search Conversations`) backed by SQLite FTS5
- `#searchChatSessions` language model tool with `describe`, `query`, and `sql` modes
- Incremental indexing: startup scan compares file modification times and only re-indexes changed or new session files
- SQLite WAL mode for non-blocking reads during indexing
- Support for workspace, global, and transferred session storage paths
- GitHub Actions build workflow producing platform-specific VSIX packages (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- GitHub Actions release workflow for VS Code Marketplace publishing (release and pre-release channels)
- ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`)
- `$(timeline-open)` icon for the extension activity bar view

### Changed
- Folded the separate "Recent Messages" panel into the main session tree view; recency is now controlled by the time-period filter
- Renamed the language model tool from `#sessionTraceSearch` to `#searchChatSessions`

### Fixed
- GitHub Actions macOS runner was using the unsupported `macos-13-us-default` configuration; updated to `macos-latest`
- Raw line index clamped with `Math.max(0, rawLines.length - 1)` to prevent out-of-bounds access
- `errorDetails?.message?.split('\n') ?? []` prevents a crash when error details are absent in a session request
- Recent view now correctly respects active scope and day filters rather than always showing a fixed window
